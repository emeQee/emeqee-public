<p>As an 80s kid, barefly born before the unification of Germany, I was too young for Hasselhoff&rsquo;s Brandenburger Tor performance. His Knight Rider series however, were big in my heart. My love for cars may have an origin right there.</p>
<p>After my high school graduation I served the mandatory service in the German army and started to attend computer science classes. During that time I had the opportunity to live in the most amazing cities. However my heart was still beating for cars so I changed my major to Automotive Engineering. My school calls it Vehicle Technology, which sounds a bit dull compared to the more common name, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I went to Yokohama for a 12 month internship and it changed myself for good. That country is lovely, the cars are grandious and people very nice. I bought my dream car there and shipped it back to Germany. This blog will be dedicated to that car.</p>
<p>Enjoy my blog,
Mehmet Emin Köklü</p>
