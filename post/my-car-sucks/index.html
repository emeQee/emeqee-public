<p>A happy new year. As we entered 2018 just a day ago, we still have a week until we enter Heisei 30, the Japanese calendar. Therefore it is a perfect time to reflect on last year. In this post however I will only write about my car. It has been a while since I purchased it, but not so long ago, that I could started enjoying it. Here is why.</p>

<p>I have been to a few car dealers in Kanagawa prefecture. I was looking for a Sprinter Trueno or a Corolla Levin hatchback. The shops I went to however were a bit of a let down. The prices were high for vehicles that were not necessarily in good shape. Even the idea of buying a project car was floating in my head. But when I went to <a href=https://emeqee.wordpress.com/2017/08/23/carland-ae86-specialty-shop/>Kyoto</a>, I actually signed a contract and purchased a <em>Kouki</em> 3dr. Sprinter Trueno. I even a rented a car park a little far away from home (cheapest I could find). The dealer however said, the delivery would take 3 months. Inspections, repair, fluid changes, registration, and the transport from Kyoto to Yokohama.</p>
<p>Even though I bought my dream car, I didn&rsquo;t want to tell anybody yet. A few peeps knew, but I was dying to receive it and make it public. Three months later, I received the car and applied for a full coverage insurance on a Friday over phone and email. The next day I was on a 2 day trip three prefectures to the north to attend a Gymkhana event. On the fourth day after delivery, when I was driving to the event after a night in Nikko, I had a head gasket blow.</p>
<p>Now the difficult part comes. I was far away from home, and even farther away from Kyoto. Now, with the hope of getting road service from my insurance, I called them. Sadly, because the insurance was done literally 1 day ago, my insurance did not show up in the system and the insurance company refused the road service. I called JAF (Japanese Automobile Federation). I am not a member of that automobile club, so they did not want to take my car back to my dealer hundreds of kilometers away. Instead only the nearest shops would work. But I don&rsquo;t know any shops in this foreign country and all the official Toyota dealers refused the car (a classic AE86). So I managed to park it at a body shop of co-workers family member.</p>
<p>My car dealer Carland86 was doing quite a lot of talking, as some of the people I had contact with, could not speak English. Carland86 can&rsquo;t either. In the end, Carland86 asked a specialty shop in Tsukuba, the famous <a href=http://www.k-m-s.org/>Koshimizu Motor Sports</a>. KMS would pick up the car from the body shop and look at it in their shop right next to Tsukuba Circuit. I had to do a lot of talking to the insurance company, to include both transfers of the car into the insurance, as they only wanted to cover the first one. Luckily, they were cooperative.</p>

<p>By this time, I could enjoy the car only a few days. It was taken away from me again and I did not know for how long. KMS however figured out, that a new head gasket alone would not fix the problem, so they were looking for a replacement engine. I thought this would take quite a time but luckily, a few weeks later, a KMS customer wanted to upgrade the engine of their AE86. So my 205k 4A-GE blue top was replaced by a 140k 4A-GE blue top. The lucky part is, that it was covered by the 3 months of warranty by Carland86.</p>
<p>On the day I got the car back how ever, the coolant temperature gauge happened to break. It worked in the moment of delivery. The problem was a fatigued wire at the connector. It was in the middle of the night and all shops were closed. In fear of over-heating, I parked the car somewhere between office and home and fixed the problem the next day with a connector from Autobacs. Right on the next day, I was in Daikoku-futo PA, where the driver side door speaker fell off.</p>

<p>Basically every time I take the car for a spin, something breaks. Like right now I need to diagnose the noises coming from the transmission, or find a new windshield to fix 3 chips which might not be repairable. The year 2017 was indeed a very unlucky affair with my car.</p>

A few weeks ago I did a day trip to Kyoto. I took the Nozomi Shinkansen, a fast traveling bullet train. I boarded it in Shin-Yokohama, and after 2 hours and 2 stops I arrived at Kyoto station. The train reached a top speed of 290 km/h or something. That is convenient. The reason for my day trip was the AE86 specialty shop Carland.
It was very hot and humid, but refreshing to see old cars.
